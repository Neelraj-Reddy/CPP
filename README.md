## Some Facts:
- When you perform function overloading the compiler assigns internal names to call various data types and this process of conversion of a name in a source file to an internally used name is called name mangling.

- The technique of allocating memory during runtime on demand is known as dynamic memory allocation.
- new, delete are the two keywords used for dynamic memory allocation in cpp.
